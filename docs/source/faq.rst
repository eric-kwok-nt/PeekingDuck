FAQ and Troubleshooting
=======================

How can I post-process and visualize model outputs?
---------------------------------------------------

The common output of all ``model`` nodes is ``bboxes``. ``bboxes`` can be used for
subsequent actions like counting (:mod:`dabble.bbox_count`), drawing (:mod:`draw.bbox`),
tagging (:mod:`draw.tag`), etc.
You can also create custom nodes which takes ``boxes`` as an input to visualize your
results.

How can I dynamically use all prior outputs as the input at run time?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Specifying ``all`` as the input allows the node to receive all prior outputs as the input.
This is used by nodes such as :mod:`draw.legend` and :mod:`output.csv_writer`.

How do I debug custom nodes?
----------------------------

You can add code in custom nodes to print the contents of their inputs.
For more info, please see the tutorial on :ref:`debugging <tutorial_debugging>`.
